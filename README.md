This was the last project of <i>Intermediate HTML and CSS</i> on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The odin project</a>. No outside help was taken. 

I learnt a lot about grids, and ran into a few problems with box-shadow but overall, it was a fun project. I learnt a lot, especially about grids.
